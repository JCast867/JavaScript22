I want to make the dashboard page of a finance app where you enter your name, bank balance, deposit, withdraw, and then exit out.
The reason I want to do this project is because for my university class at DePaul, I'm in a group where we're making a 
project like that. So what better way to kill two birds with one stone. It'll give me more time to work on my page and make
it look the best way possible with JavaScript in it. For my project at DePaul, I'm going to have more pages but those are
using Python/Django and it'll be too complicated. So, I only want to focus on the dashboard page for this project.
The only down side is that the user will have to manually enter the values themselves. But, it will be calculated by the
application itself.
